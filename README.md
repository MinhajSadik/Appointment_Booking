```# Appointment Booking Description
Description:

Build an application to make an easy appointment between a student and the course teacher of a University. There will be three types of users: System Admin, Teacher, and Student. The system will only allow access to logged-in users.

The system will allow users to register as a teacher or students. The teacher must complete their profile and set their available daily hours in a week. Teachers will also be able to see their appointment list and approve or reject the appointment request. There will also be an option to see their daily or upcoming appointment list on the dashboard.

The student will be able to see the available teachers list. They can search by department or course and see their profile with available hours. The system will also allow them to see their appointment list on the dashboard.
